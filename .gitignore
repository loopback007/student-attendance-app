# Flask specific
instance/*
# Ignore the instance folder by default.
# If you need to track specific files in instance (e.g. a default config),
# use negated patterns like:
# !instance/some_specific_file.cfg
# However, for SQLite DBs or secrets, they should generally be ignored.
# Our app.db is now handled by Docker volumes in the containerized setup,
# but if you run locally without Docker and it's in instance/, this will ignore it.
# If app.db is in the root for local dev, add 'app.db' below.

# SQLite
# If you run locally and app.db is in the project root (not instance/ or a volume)
app.db
app.db-journal # SQLite journal file

# Backup directory (if created within the project and not in instance/)
# Our current backup logic puts them in instance/db_backups/, so instance/* covers it.
# If you had a root-level db_backups/:
